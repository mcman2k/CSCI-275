<b><h3 id="Data Structures">Data Structures</h3></b>
<p>This class I'm taking this semester is the most important class. I expect much of the
programming that is done in this class to be much more intensive than my previous courses
that I have taken in college so far.</p>

</br>
</br>

<b><h3 id="Northern Illinois University">Northern Illinois University</h3></b>
<p>Although I initially wanted to go to University of Illinois in Chicago, I wasn't accepted,
and ultimately chose Northern Illinois to continue my education in Computer Science to earn
my Bachelor's Degree by 2015.</p>

</br>
</br>

<b><h3 id="Target">Target</h3></b>
<p>Around the time before I finished high school, I was in dire need of a job. Luckily, in the
summer of 2009, which was around the same time that gas prices were unusually low, I earned this
job at Target near Woodfield Mall. I've been there for as long as 5 years now, and I plan on continuing
to work there until I've finally graduated with a BS here at NIU.</p>

</br>
</br>

<b><h3 id="Ford Focus">Ford Focus</h3></b>
<p>My first car. Although the current car I have is the second Ford Focus I've been driving, these
cars are very reliable, and run well on such high mileage. My gold Focus I own now hasn't given
me any trouble yet, but because I've already experienced some issues with my previous car, I'm
prepared to deal with any issues and have the ability to resolve them quicker than before.</p>

</br>
</br>

<b><h3 id="Paris, France">Paris, France</h3></b>
<p>At one point, I almost traveled here for a relatives wedding, but unfortunately I didn't.
This city is beautiful, and as much as I want to travel the world someday, this would be the
first place I would venture to.</p>
