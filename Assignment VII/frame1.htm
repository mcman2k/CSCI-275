	<p class="text" align="center">Each frame will describe some of 
	the elements from what has been directed in this assignment. There 
	will be a nice bit of content to show how talented I am as an HTML
	scripter and Computer Scientist. But seriously, this will showcase 
	some of the formats of what a frame is capable of displaying, including
	this short paragraph, using an embedded style sheet and a generic font,
	a second frame showing how font colors and sizes can vary, with the emphasis on 
	the exact word of the same color, and in the final frame, when a picture 
	is placed in a region of the frame that cannot be initially seen on the page,
	and takes further advantage of auto scrolling to allow for access to the rest
	of the picture.</p>
